## FAQ

#### Question
Can you explain in more detail how your platform uses blockchain technology?

Answer

Our platform uses blockchain technology to ensure the security and transparency of all transactions and interactions on the platform. Each NGO and donor account is encrypted with a unique private key, which ensures that all data and transactions are tamper-proof and can be easily audited. Additionally, blockchain technology enables us to create a decentralized database that can be easily accessed and shared by all NGOs and donors, which increases efficiency and reduces costs.( using Etherium blockchain with payment in solana to give cheaper option.)

#### Question
How do you plan to attract users to your platform?

Answer

We have a multi-pronged user acquisition strategy that includes social media marketing, partnerships with other organizations, and word-of-mouth referrals. We plan to leverage social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to reach potential users and generate buzz around our platform. We also plan to partner with other organizations in the NGO sector, such as UNICEF and Save the Children, to gain credibility and increase our reach. Finally, we believe that word-of-mouth referrals will be a key driver of user growth, as satisfied users will be likely to recommend our platform to their friends and family.

#### Question
Can you provide more details about your revenue model and financial projections?

Answer

Our revenue model is based on a commission-based system, where we take a small percentage of each transaction made on the platform. This includes donations made to NGOs, as well as any fees associated with using the platform's resources, such as hiring volunteers or renting equipment. Our expenses include platform development costs, marketing and user acquisition costs, and operational costs associated with maintaining the platform.

#### Question
How do you plan to ensure the sustainability of your platform over the long term?

Answer

We believe that sustainability is key to the success of our platform, and we have several strategies in place to ensure that the platform remains viable over the long term. First, we plan to continually update and improve the platform based on user feedback, ensuring that it remains relevant and useful. Second, we plan to build partnerships with NGOs, donors, and other stakeholders in the sector to increase our reach and build a community around our platform. Finally, we plan to explore alternative revenue streams, such as selling data and insights derived from the platform's data, to supplement our commission-based revenue model.
