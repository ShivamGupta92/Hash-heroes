- Our platform offers a transparent and efficient way to donate to NGOs using blockchain technology and Solana payment.
## The Problem We're Solving

- There are thousands of NGOs around the world doing incredible work to support vulnerable communities. 
- However, it can be challenging for people to find reliable NGOs that they can trust with their donations. 
- In many cases, people don't know where their donations are going, or whether they are having the impact that they hope for. 
- This can make it difficult for people to donate with confidence, and can limit the impact of NGOs that are doing important work.
## Why iHelp?

iHelp is a unique platform that offers a number of benefits to users who want to donate to NGOs:

- Transparency: iHelp uses blockchain technology to ensure that all transactions are transparent and secure, providing donors with peace of mind and enabling them to see the impact of their donations.

- Reliability: All NGOs listed on our platform are vetted and verified, ensuring that donors can trust that their donations will be used effectively to support communities in need.

- Efficiency: iHelp uses Solana payment, which is fast and efficient, providing users with a fast and reliable payment experience.

- Impact: By using iHelp, users can support NGOs that are doing important work around the world, helping to make a real difference in the lives of people in need.
